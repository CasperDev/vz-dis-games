VZ Ghost Hunter

Avoid the Ghosts and Eat all the Dots in a Maze

There are 4 Power Pills, one in each corner - they are Large Flashing Dots.

Eating one of these will allow you to Chase the Ghost.
When the screen returns to its original colour your chase time is up.

After the third Frame a Bonus Symbol will randomly appear below the Ghost Cage.
If it is not Eaten in time then the Walls of Maze will disappear.
